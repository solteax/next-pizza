# 🍕 next-pizza

**Here is my new pet project built with Next.js and a modern frontend stack** — created during a break from the latest commercial development, simply for fun, learning, and portfolio-building.

## 🧭 Why?

After wrapping up my last professional project, I finally had time to build something outside the day job — something small, functional, and fun. I wanted to dive back into modern web tools and rediscover the joy of crafting a UI from scratch.

This app was originally started using **Next.js 14**, before the release of version 15. I’ve decided to stick with 14 for now to keep things consistent and avoid unnecessary refactoring, especially since the core features I wanted are already in place.

📌 *Note: I'm a frontend developer by trade, so while the backend in this project is not ideal, it does the job for what I needed. The focus is mostly on UI/UX and client-side logic.*

## 🧱 What's Next?

There’s still plenty of room for improvement — from small UI refinements to backend enhancements and new features. But for now, I’ve wrapped this version intentionally. It captures exactly what I set out to build: a crisp, focused experiment in modern frontend development.
